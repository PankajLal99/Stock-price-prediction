Determining the future values of the stocks of a company by using machine learning algorithms such as
regression is known as Stock market price prediction. The more accurate the model gets, the more profit the
user or investor can make. This paper proposes techniques and models that can be used to predict stock
market values accurately. By only using previous years stock market prices, the prediction made might not
be accurate. Hence by using machine learning and assigning ‘weights’ to each parameter that changes the
prices we can find out which parameter is the most important and which is not. Then the model can be
trained accordingly with the values and then the prediction made will be much more accurate. Predicting
stock price change rates for providing valuable information to investors is a challenging task. Individual
participants may express their opinions in social network service (SNS) before or after their transactions in
the market; we hypothesize that stock price change rate is better predicted by a function of social network
service activities and technical indicators than by a function of just stock market activities. The hypothesis
is tested by accuracy of predictions as well as performance of simulated trading because success or failure
of prediction is better measured by profits or losses the investors gain or suffer. In this paper, we propose a
hybrid model that combines multiple kernel learning (MKL) and genetic algorithm (GA). MKL is adopted
to optimize the stock price change rate prediction models that are expressed in a multiple kernel linear
function of different types of features extracted from different sources. GA is used to optimize the trading
rules used in the simulated trading by fusing the return predictions and values of three well-known
overbought and oversold technical indicators. Accumulated return and Sharpe ratio were used to test the
goodness of performance of the simulated trading. Experimental results show that our proposed model
performed better than other models including ones using state of the art techniques.
